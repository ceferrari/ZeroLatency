**ZeroLatency** is a highly opinionated PowerShell script for Windows that prioritizes maximum system responsiveness and lowest possible latency above all else. Tailored for gamers, audio professionals, and users with real-time workloads, it aggressively debloats Windows by removing pre-installed packages, AI, accessibility, and gaming overlays. It disables unnecessary services, telemetry, indexing, and power-saving features. It optimizes network settings (potentially achieving A+ [Bufferbloat](https://www.waveform.com/tools/bufferbloat) ratings even without a SQM router) and power settings, keeping CPU cores unparked. While prioritizing performance over security and power efficiency, it preserves essential functionality including Windows Defender, Windows Update, Microsoft Store, and WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), the latter being a key feature for developers.

In addition to the provided information, the script is not intended for every user or scenario. It is specifically designed for Windows 11 and has not been tested on any other versions. The network optimizations assume a stable, high-quality link, such as fiber, and may not be as effective on unstable or low-quality connections. Users who require high throughput for tasks like simultaneous streaming while gaming may need to tweak the script to suit their specific needs. The script also does not focus on security hardening; for that purpose, users should look into specialized tools like the [Harden Windows Security](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security) script. Furthermore, while the script will undoubtedly improve gaming performance, its primary goal is to achieve minimum latency, not to maximize raw FPS.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This script makes significant modifications to your Windows system configuration. Use it at your own risk. We are not responsible for any instability, data loss, security vulnerabilities, hardware damage, or any other issues that may result from using this script. It is highly recommended to create a system restore point before proceeding.

## üìã Prerequisites

- [Windows 11](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11)
  - It is recommended to begin with a clean installation of Windows 11. Using it on an earlier version or an already existing installation increases the risk of issues
  - After the installation, ensure your system is fully updated through both Windows Update and the Microsoft Store before running the script
  - We suggest using [Rufus](https://rufus.ie) to create a bootable USB and customize it to use a local account instead of requiring a Microsoft account
- [PowerShell 7](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows)
  - The script relies on features exclusive to PowerShell version 7 or newer and is not compatible with the version 5 that comes pre-installed with Windows
  - The recommended method by Microsoft to install it is via WinGet, simply running the following command on Terminal (PowerShell or Command Prompt)

```powershell
winget install --id Microsoft.PowerShell --source winget
```

## üöÄ Usage

1. Install or update to most recent version of NIC drivers
   - [Realtek](https://www.realtek.com/Download/List?cate_id=584) (select NDIS - Not Support Power Saving)
   - [Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/15084/intel-ethernet-adapter-complete-driver-pack.html)
2. Activate a Power Plan of choice
3. Download the ZeroLatency.ps1 file
4. Open the script using an IDE of choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code)
5. Go through the steps, change the variables and save
6. Run the script by double clicking it
7. (Optional but highly recommended) Check Extra

## üß© Extra

This script focuses on maximizing system responsiveness and minimizing latency through automated tweaks, but there are additional tools that can complement its effects. These tools further enhance optimizations that are highly system-specific, hardware-dependent, or otherwise impractical to replicate fully within a single script. For example, utilities like MSI-specific tuning software provide granular control over interrupt handling and core assignment across diverse hardware configurations. Using them alongside this script can help achieve even lower latency and a more finely tuned system without duplicating effort.

### [Go Interrupt Policy](https://github.com/spddl/GoInterruptPolicy)

Modern and comprehensive utility designed to replace older tools like the [Interrupt Affinity Tool](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/microsoft-interrupt-affinity-tool) and [MSI Tool](https://forums.guru3d.com/threads/windows-line-based-vs-message-signaled-based-interrupts-msi-tool.378044), providing a single solution for optimizing device interrupts in Windows. The software's primary function is to manage Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI), a more efficient, lower latency method of interrupt handling compared to traditional line-based interrupts, by allowing users to control interrupt priorities and assign specific CPU cores affinities to handle device interrupts.
